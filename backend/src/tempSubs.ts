// 00:01:28,911,

// In education, the one thing\n

// 00:01:42,048,
//   endTimeMs: 00:01:44,142
// depends on much more

// 00:01:44,166,
//   endTimeMs: 00:01:47,546
// than your ability to learn\n
// quickly and easily?

// 00:01:48,371,
//   endTimeMs: 00:01:50,297
// So I left the classroom,

// 00:01:50,321,
//   endTimeMs: 00:01:53,312
// and I went to graduate school\n
// to become a psychologist.

// 00:01:53,877,
//   endTimeMs: 00:01:56,027
// I started studying kids and adults

// 00:01:56,051,
//   endTimeMs: 00:01:58,884
// in all kinds of super\n
// challenging settings,

// 00:01:58,908,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:01,336
// and in every study my question was,

// 00:02:01,360,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:03,606
// who is successful here and why?

// 00:02:04,384,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:07,977
// My research team and I went\n
// to West Point Military Academy.

// 00:02:08,476,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:10,136
// We tried to predict which cadets

// 00:02:10,160,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:13,668
// would stay in military training\n
// and which would drop out.

// 00:02:14,414,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:16,645
// We went to the National Spelling Bee

// 00:02:16,669,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:21,208
// and tried to predict which children\n
// would advance farthest in competition.

// 00:02:21,867,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:25,923
// We studied rookie teachers\n
// working in really tough neighborhoods,

// 00:02:25,947,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:29,364
// asking which teachers are still\n
// going to be here in teaching

// 00:02:29,388,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:31,382
// by the end of the school year,

// 00:02:31,406,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:34,417
// and of those, who will be\n
// the most effective

// 00:02:34,441,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:37,125
// at improving learning\n
// outcomes for their students?

// 00:02:37,592,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:39,822
// We partnered with private\n
// companies, asking,

// 00:02:39,846,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:42,541
// which of these salespeople\n
// is going to keep their jobs?

// 00:02:42,565,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:44,431
// And who's going to earn the most money?

// 00:02:44,797,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:47,455
// In all those very different contexts,

// 00:02:47,479,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:51,980
// one characteristic emerged\n
// as a significant predictor of success.

// 00:02:52,464,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:54,242
// And it wasn't social intelligence.

// 00:02:54,662,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:57,647
// It wasn't good looks, physical health,

// 00:02:57,671,
//   endTimeMs: 00:02:58,989
// and it wasn't IQ.

// 00:02:59,758,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:00,874
// It was grit.

// 00:03:01,899,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:06,529
// Grit is passion and perseverance\n
// for very long-term goals.

// 00:03:06,989,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:08,660
// Grit is having stamina.

// 00:03:09,232,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:13,438
// Grit is sticking with your future,\n
// day in, day out,

// 00:03:13,462,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:16,827
// not just for the week,\n
// not just for the month,

// 00:03:16,851,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:18,383
// but for years,

// 00:03:18,407,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:22,128
// and working really hard\n
// to make that future a reality.

// 00:03:22,969,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:27,238
// Grit is living life\n
// like it's a marathon, not a sprint.

// 00:03:28,156,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:29,587
// A few years ago,

// 00:03:29,611,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:32,625
// 'I started studying grit\n
// in the Chicago public schools.'

// 00:03:33,141,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:35,429
// I asked thousands of high school juniors

// 00:03:35,453,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:37,281
// to take grit questionnaires,

// 00:03:37,305,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:39,257
// and then waited around more than a year

// 00:03:39,281,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:40,637
// to see who would graduate.

// 00:03:41,518,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:43,740
// Turns out that grittier kids

// 00:03:43,764,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:46,944
// were significantly more\n
// likely to graduate,

// 00:03:46,968,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:50,730
// even when I matched them\n
// on every characteristic I could measure,

// 00:03:50,754,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:53,004
// things like family income,

// 00:03:53,028,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:55,750
// standardized achievement test scores,

// 00:03:55,774,
//   endTimeMs: 00:03:58,798
// even how safe kids felt\n
// when they were at school.

// 00:03:59,377,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:02,314
// So it's not just at West Point
// or the National Spelling Bee

// 00:04:02,338,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:03,452
// that grit matters.

// 00:04:03,476,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:05,417
// It's also in school,

// 00:04:05,441,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:07,822
// especially for kids\n
// at risk for dropping out.

// 00:04:09,116,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:12,074
// To me, the most shocking thing about grit

// 00:04:12,098,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:14,057
// is how little we know,

// 00:04:14,081,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:16,583
// how little science knows,\n
// about building it.

// 00:04:17,003,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:19,254
// Every day, parents and teachers ask me,

// 00:04:19,278,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:21,478
// "How do I build grit in kids?

// 00:04:21,502,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:24,419
// What do I do to teach kids\n
// a solid work ethic?

// 00:04:24,753,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:27,241
// How do I keep them motivated\n
// for the long run?"

// 00:04:27,860,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:29,835
// The honest answer is,

// 00:04:29,859,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:30,936
// I don't know.

// 00:04:30,960,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:32,435
// (Laughter)

// 00:04:32,459,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:35,498
// What I do know is that talent\n
// doesn't make you gritty.

// 00:04:35,522,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:37,853
// Our data show very clearly

// 00:04:37,877,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:40,290
// that there are many talented individuals

// 00:04:40,314,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:43,433
// who simply do not follow through\n
// on their commitments.

// 00:04:43,814,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:48,028
// In fact, in our data,\n
// grit is usually unrelated

// 00:04:48,052,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:51,173
// or even inversely related\n
// to measures of talent.

// 00:04:52,465,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:56,560
// So far, the best idea I've heard\n
// about building grit in kids

// 00:04:56,584,
//   endTimeMs: 00:04:58,806
// is something called "growth mindset."

// 00:04:59,449,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:03,119
// This is an idea developed\n
// at Stanford University by Carol Dweck,

// 00:05:03,143,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:08,241
// and it is the belief that the ability\n
// to learn is not fixed,

// 00:05:08,265,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:10,732
// that it can change with your effort.

// 00:05:11,440,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:12,759
// Dr. Dweck has shown

// 00:05:12,783,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:15,918
// that when kids read\n
// and learn about the brain

// 00:05:15,942,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:19,416
// and how it changes and grows\n
// in response to challenge,

// 00:05:19,440,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:23,437
// they're much more likely
// to persevere when they fail,

// 00:05:23,461,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:28,070
// because they don't believe that failure\n
// is a permanent condition.

// 00:05:29,052,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:32,182
// So growth mindset\n
// is a great idea for building grit.

// 00:05:32,724,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:34,261
// But we need more.

// 00:05:34,825,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:36,921
// And that's where I'm going\n
// to end my remarks,

// 00:05:36,945,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:38,291
// because that's where we are.

// 00:05:38,315,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:40,480
// That's the work that stands before us.

// 00:05:40,504,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:44,384
// We need to take our best ideas,\n
// our strongest intuitions,

// 00:05:44,408,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:46,043
// and we need to test them.

// 00:05:46,512,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:49,223
// We need to measure
// whether we've been successful,

// 00:05:49,247,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:52,953
// and we have to be willing\n
// to fail, to be wrong,

// 00:05:52,977,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:55,615
// to start over again with lessons learned.

// 00:05:56,336,
//   endTimeMs: 00:05:59,280
// In other words, we need to be gritty

// 00:05:59,304,
//   endTimeMs: 00:06:01,773
// about getting our kids grittier.

// 00:06:02,177,
//   endTimeMs: 00:06:03,209
// Thank you.
